# Student Lifestyle and Academic Performance

## Project overview

This SQL project explores the relationship between various lifestyle, behavioral, and environmental factors with student exam performance. Using a single comprehensive "stu" table, we analyze how factors like study hours, social media usage, diet, sleep, and mental health impact student outcomes.
The aim is to extract actionable insights that could help students, educators, and counselors better understand the factors affecting student success.


## 🗂️ Database Structure
The database for this project consists of a single table named stu, which holds all relevant student-related data. Each record in the table represents one student and captures a comprehensive range of attributes related to their lifestyle, study habits, and academic performance.

Key personal identifiers such as student_id, age, and gender are included to define individual profiles. Study-related behaviors are captured through columns like study_hours_per_day, attendance_percentage, and exam_score. The dataset also includes lifestyle metrics such as sleep_hours, diet_quality, and exercise_frequency, along with digital consumption patterns measured through social_media_hours, netflix_hours, and internet_quality.

Socioeconomic and background factors are represented by fields like parental_education_level and part_time_job. Additionally, wellness and engagement indicators such as mental_health_rating and extracurricular_participation help provide a holistic view of each student's overall routine and mindset.

This structure enables insightful analysis across multiple dimensions—academic, behavioral, digital, and health-related—to better understand how lifestyle factors influence student outcomes.

## 🎯 Objectives
Analyze the effect of lifestyle habits on academic performance.

Identify patterns and correlations using SQL queries.

Understand which factors contribute most to higher exam scores.

Segment students based on their behavior and wellness patterns.	  

## Data Analysis

1. Show the list of all student records.  
2. Display the number of male and female students.  
3. What is the average study time per day among students?  
4. List students who study more than 4 hours per day.  
5. Find the average exam score. 
6. Show the total number of students with a part-time job.  
7. Retrieve the highest and lowest exam scores.  
8. List all students with attendance below 75%.  
9. Show students who sleep less than 6 hours.  
10. Display the count of students by parental education level.
11. Find the average exam score grouped by gender.  
12. List students who study more and use social media less than the average.  
13. Which diet quality group has the highest average exam score?  
14. Rank students by their exam scores (highest to lowest).  
15. Show students with both high mental health rating and high exam score.
16. Analyze average sleep hours by exercise frequency.
17. Check if extracurricular participation impacts average exam score.
